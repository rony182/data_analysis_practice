# Overview

As a software engineer passionate about data-driven insights in sports, I developed this project to delve into the complexities of football player performance and market dynamics. By leveraging detailed performance data, I aim to uncover correlations that can inform strategic decisions in sports management and player development.

The data set analyzed in this project is a comprehensive collection of football player statistics and market valuations sourced from Transfermarkt, an established database in the sports industry known for its accuracy and depth of player data. This dataset includes metrics such as goals, assists, minutes played, and market values across multiple seasons.

The purpose of writing this software was to apply data analysis techniques to real-world datasets, enhancing my skills in data manipulation, visualization, and interpretation. This project serves as a practical application of my programming abilities and helps me understand the quantitative aspects that influence player valuations and team performances in professional football.

# Data Analysis Results

### Which players have shown the most improvement over the last season?
- I found that players like Mauro Icardi and Santiago Gimenez showed significant improvements in goals scored from the previous season.
### How do changes in performance metrics correlate with market value changes? 
- There was a moderate correlation, suggesting that improvements in performance metrics like goals and assists are positively associated with increases in player market values.

# Development Environment

- Python: A powerful, versatile programming language that excels in data analysis and machine learning tasks.
- Pandas: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For creating visualizations to explore data trends and correlations.
- Jupyter Notebook: An interactive computing environment that facilitates live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
